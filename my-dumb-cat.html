    <p>I have had my dumb cat Cleyre since May 2015.  She is pretty stupid, and I will tell you all of the reasons why:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>She doesn't bury her own poop (WTF)</li>
        <li>She sleeps all the time</li>
        <li>She is very fluffy</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Her hair is everywhere</li>
            <li>I can no longer wear any dark colored clothing</li>
          </ul>
        <li>She cries if there is a hole in her food bowl</li>
      </ul>
    <p>She isn't all bad though.  Here are some of my favorite things about her, in order:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>She lays on my chest when I go to bed and purrs until I fall asleep</li>
        <li>When she lays on the couch in a ball, she looks like a fluffy donut</li>
      </ol>
    <p>Thank you for reading!  One day, I will add an image!</p>
